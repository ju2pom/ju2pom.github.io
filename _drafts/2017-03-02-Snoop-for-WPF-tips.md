# A great WPF tool
(Snoop homepage)[https://snoopwpf.codeplex.com/]
Snoop for WPF is a quite old tool (last release update was in 2012) but I can't work on WPF/Xaml without it. I can even say that it's always launched on my computer.
Here is what it looks like

## Pros

- I like it's minimal size, thanks to that I can keep it alaws opened
- As it's a standalone tool you don't have to enable/disable anything in Visual Studio
- Your application UI stays very clean even when you are inspecting it
- You can use snoop's property grid on top of your window without having Visual Studio poping on top !
